Application layer acts as a bridge between the core/domain and the outside world

## Key Responsibilities:
1. Define **Services**:
   - Implement business workflows by coordinating with the Domain Layer and Infrastructure.
2. Define **Interfaces**:
   - Specify contracts for application services and dependencies (e.g., `IUserService`).
3. Map **DTOs**:
   - Use Data Transfer Objects to transform domain entities into API-friendly formats.
4. Validate **Inputs**:
   - Perform validation before passing data to the Domain Layer.
